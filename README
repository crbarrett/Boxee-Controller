Abstract:
Genesis of a project to give me remote control of Boxee using the SqueezeBoxController (SBC).

Design:
At this point just a brute-force access to a single running Boxee instance.  IP and ports are hard-coded as well as username and passwords.

Testing:
Only tried on the SqueezePlay so far, no testing on device hardware.

Future:
Discovery
New UI on the device split amongst the content types being managed
A play sub-menu for controlling playback only/separately
Using the scroll wheel and other dedciated control buttons to control the remote interface ???
More commands
